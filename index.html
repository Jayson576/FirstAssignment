Icing is better depending on time, and your cooking skills. If you are pressed for time cream cheese icing is the way to go, but if you want your red velvet cake to have a smooth, buttery frosting. Topping your red velvet cake with ermine frosting is the way to go.</p>

                   <li>Beat shortening and 1 1/2 cups sugar until very light and fluffy. Add eggs and beat well.</il>
                   <li>Make a paste of cocoa and red food coloring; add to creamed mixture. Mix salt, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and buttermilk together. Add the flour to the batter, alternating with the buttermilk mixture, mixing just until incorporated. Mix soda and vinegar and gently fold into cake batter. Don't beat or stir the batter after this point.</il>
                   <li>Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted into the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool cakes completely on wire rack.</il>

While mixture is cooling, beat 1 cup sugar, butter, and 1 teaspoon vanilla until light and fluffy. Add cooled flour mixture and beat until frosting is a good spreading consistency.
